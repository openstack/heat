deprecations:
  - |
    The ``heat-api`` console script and the ``heat-api-cfn`` console script,
    which are used to launch standalone api services, have been deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release. It is now highly recommended to Use
    the wsgi scripts (or wsgi applications directly) instead.
