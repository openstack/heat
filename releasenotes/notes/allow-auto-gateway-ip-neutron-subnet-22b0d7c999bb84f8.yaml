    Added support for ``auto`` as a valid value for the ``gateway_ip``
    property in the ``OS::Neutron::Subnet`` resource. This allows Heat
    templates to explicitly specify ``auto``. Note that ``auto`` can only be
    used during subnet creation; it is not supported when updating an
    existing subnet.
