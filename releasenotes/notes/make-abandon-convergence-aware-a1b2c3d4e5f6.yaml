    Stack abandon action is now convergence aware. When convergence engine is
    enabled, abandoning a stack now uses the convergence workflow for resource
    cleanup, allowing for better parallelism and consistency with other stack
    operations. Physical resources are retained (not deleted) while Heat's
    database records are cleaned up through the convergence flow.
