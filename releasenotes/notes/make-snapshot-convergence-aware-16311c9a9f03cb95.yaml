features:
  - |
    Stack snapshot and restore actions are now convergence aware. Snapshots
    are integrated into the convergence dependency graph, enabling non-blocking
    snapshot deletion during stack delete operations. This improves performance
    by allowing snapshot cleanup to be processed in parallel with the
    convergence workflow rather than blocking the entire operation.

upgrade:
  - |
    A new database table ``resource_snapshot`` has been introduced to store
    per-resource snapshot data for convergence mode. This table is
    automatically created during database migration.
