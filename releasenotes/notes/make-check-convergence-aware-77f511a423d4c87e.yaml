features:

    Stack check action is now convergence aware. When convergence is enabled,
    stack check will traverse through all resources using the convergence
    engine instead of the legacy sequential approach. This allows check to
    continue processing remaining resources even if some resources fail
    their check, providing a complete picture of the stack's health.
upgrade:
  - |
    The RPC API version has been bumped to 1.37 for the engine service and
    1.6 for the worker service to support the convergence-aware stack check
    feature. Operators performing rolling upgrades should ensure all heat
    services are upgraded together.
