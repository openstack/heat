    Fixed an issue where long error messages from external services
    (such as Nova errors containing large base64-encoded user_data) would
    exceed MySQL's TEXT column limit (65,535 bytes) when being stored in the
    ``status_reason`` field. This caused database constraint violations that
    left resources in inconsistent states with unreleased locks, preventing
    stack DELETE operations from completing. The database layer now truncates
    ``status_reason`` to 65,535 bytes when using MySQL to prevent this issue.
