There are several bootstrap methods for cloudformations:
1. Create image with application ready to go
2. Use cloud-init to run a startup script passed as userdata to the nova
   server create
3. Use the CloudFormation instance helper scripts

This directory contains files required for choice #3.

cfn-init   - Reads the AWS::CloudFormation::Init for the instance resource,
             installs packages, and starts services
cfn-signal - Waits for an application to be ready before continuing, ie:
             supporting the WaitCondition feature
cfn-hup    - Handle updates from the UpdateStack CloudFormation API call
