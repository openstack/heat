  required: true
  type: string
environment:
  description: |
    A JSON environment for the stack.
  in: body
  required: false
  type: object
files:
  description: |
    Supplies the contents of files referenced in the template or the
    environment. Stack templates and resource templates can explicitly
    reference files by using the ``get_file`` intrinsic function. In
    addition, the ``environment`` parameter can contain implicit
    references to files.

    The value is a JSON object, where each key is a relative or
    absolute URI which serves as the name of a file, and the associated
    value provides the contents of the file. The following code shows
    the general structure of this parameter.

    .. code-block:: json

       { ...
           "files": {
               "fileA.yaml": "Contents of the file",
               "file:///usr/fileB.template": "Contents of the file",
               "http://example.com/fileC.template": "Contents of the file"
           }
       ...
       }

    Additionally, some template authors encode their user data in a
    local file. The Orchestration client examines the template for the
    ``get_file`` intrinsic function and adds an entry to the ``files``
    map with the path to the file as the name and the file contents as
    the value. So, a simple example looks like this:

    .. code-block:: json

       {
          "files": {
             "myfile": "#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello world\" > /root/testfile.txt"
          },
          ...,
          "stack_name": "teststack",
          "template": {
             ...,
             "resources": {
                "my_server": {
                   "type": "OS::Nova::Server",
                   "properties": {
                      ...,
                      "user_data": {
                         "get_file": "myfile"
                      }
                   }
                }
             }
          },
          "timeout_mins": 60
       }

    Do not use this parameter to provide the content of the template
    located at the ``template_url`` address. Instead, use the
    ``template`` parameter to supply the template content as part of
    the request.

parameters:
  description: |
    Supplies arguments for parameters defined in the stack template.

    The value is a JSON object, where each key is the name of a
    parameter defined in the template and the associated value is the
    argument to use for that parameter when instantiating the template.
    The following code shows the general structure of this parameter.
    In the example, ``a`` and ``b`` would be the names of two
    parameters defined in the template.

    .. code-block:: json

       { ...
           "parameters": {
               "a": "Value",
               "b": "3"
           }
       ...
       }

    While the service accepts JSON numbers for parameters with the type
    ``number`` and JSON objects for parameters with the type ``json``,
    all parameter values are converted to their string representation
    for storage in the created Stack. Clients are encouraged to send
    all parameter values using their string representation for
    consistency between requests and responses from the Orchestration
    service.

    A value must be provided for each template parameter which does not
    specify a default value. However, this parameter is not allowed to
    contain JSON properties with names that do not match a parameter
    defined in the template.

    The ``files`` parameter maps logical file names to file contents.
    Both the ``get_file`` intrinsic function and provider template
    functionality use this mapping. When you want to use a provider
    template, for example, the Orchestration service adds an entry to
    the ``files`` map by using:

    - The URL of the provider template as the name.

    - The contents of that file as the value.

    Additionally, some template authors encode their user data in a
    local file. The Orchestration client examines the template for the
    ``get_file`` intrinsic function and adds an entry to the ``files``
    map with the path to the file as the name and the file contents as
    the value. So, a simple example looks like this:

    .. code-block:: json

       {
          "files": {
             "myfile": "#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello world\" > /root/testfile.txt"
          },
          ...,
          "stack_name": "teststack",
          "template": {
             ...,
             "resources": {
                "my_server": {
                   "type": "OS::Nova::Server",

                      ...,
                      "user_data": {
                         "get_file": "myfile"
                      }
                   }
                }
             }
          },
